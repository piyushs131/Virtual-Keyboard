# Virtual-Keyboard
Virtual Keyboard using python libraries like cvzone and pynput
virtual keyboard made using Python is a software-based input device that allows users to input text or commands without the need for a physical keyboard. This virtual keyboard is typically created using Python programming language and graphical user interface (GUI) libraries like cvzone and pynput

This virtual keyboard interface is displayed on the user's screen and consists of a set of keys that emulate the functionality of a physical keyboard. Users can interact with the virtual keys by raising their hand in front of camera. The Python code behind the virtual keyboard manages the keypress events and translates them into corresponding characters or actions.
